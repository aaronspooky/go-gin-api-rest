# API REST using Gin
In this project I'm using Gin as Web framework.

## Getting started
Go version: 1.16.

First off, install dependencies. Run `go mod download`, this command should install dependencies.

Run `go run main.go` to start the local server (Stop server using `ctrl + c`).

In your HTTP Client use `127.0.0.1:8080`.

Any recommendations are welcome!
